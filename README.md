# CVA
Code for Crystallographic Vorticity Axis analysis

The provided code snippets are functions that can be run in Matlab and are written to leverage functionality from the open source toolbox, MTEX, v3.5 and v4.0 (which provides tools for importing EBSD data and constructing GrainSet objects). The function names describe which version of MTEX they are intended for â€“ if no specification is given, then the function should work with either version. Some details about the CVA method (and appropriate references) are provided in comments within the functions. 

Please contact Z.Michels with any questions or for consultationuse and feel free to modify these functions as allowed by the MIT open source license guidelines.
